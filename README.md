# Anki: Dynamic Clickable Special Character Buttons With Reverse
A version of ["Clickable Special Character Input Buttons"](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/399996471) by [/u/nukeychess](https://reddit.com/u/nukeychess) that dynamically generates buttons for any non-ASCII characters that you need to type based on your card's fields, and sorts them to avoid hinting at the answer.

In other words, you don't need to pre-configure anything in the code. Just type whatever you want, and buttons for special characters will be generated as needed.

Main code is [here](note-types.org).
